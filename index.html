          I am an Informatics student at the University of Washington. I never expected to end up working in the technology field, and I definitely never anticipated being as passionate about it as I am. During my time at UW, I have immersed myself in programming classes, classes on information ethics, and information systems analysis and management. In addition to my major, I am working towards a math minor as well as an art history minor. As a minority in the tech field, I am a huge advocate in diversifying the workforce. However, I don't believe this should be done through contrived hiring practices, I prefer to work at the problem from a different angle. I have participated in several community events geared towards getting children, particularly young girls interested in technology and computing. There is so much this field has to offer, and so many people who may miss out on it because they weren't exposed to the computational way of thinking early enough to pursue it.

          I am a Washingtonian by birth and a Seattleite by choice. I love a good cup of coffee, rain boots, dystopian lit, and living in a city that is so outdoorsy. When I have downtime (which is rare and precious), I generally go running, visit the farmers market, read, and do crosswords.

          <p>
            As an Undergraduate TA in the University of Washington Computer Science Department, I teach a weekly discussion session with approximately twenty students during which we discuss and apply Java concepts. I also work closely with UW faculty and other TAs to write and modify grading criteria, which we then use to grade students' weekly homework assignments. The experience gives me an opportunity to sharpen my programming and code analysis skills while becoming a more confident public speaker and communicator.

          <p>
            Through Microsoft's Explore Program, I had the unique opportunity to follow a project through three stages of development. I cycled through the roles of Program Management, Software Developer, and Software Tester on the Trustworthy Computing Security Tools team. As a PM, I designed and wrote a functional specification document for a web application based on a concept described by my team. During my development phase, I wrote the code for the tool according to my specifications. Finally, as a tester I wrote a testing infrastructure to allow full-time developers on my team testing flexibility and clarity when they took on development of the tool.

            During an academic quarter, I worked closely with a member of the University of Washington faculty and several other UW students to promote Computer Science, Informatics, and related areas of study. We visit K-12 schools in the greater Seattle area and provide students with activities intended to expose them to the diverse and fun world of technology. I continue to volunteer at individual outreach events.

          <p>
            The Massai Women Education and Empowerment Program (MWEEP) provides young women in Kenya and Tanzania the resources to attend secondary school and entrepreneurial classes. I organized and hosted a fundraising event for which I asked business owners in my community to donate items to be raffled off. I also asked prominent women in my community to speak at the event on the theme, "Intelligence is Beautiful". My goal was to emphasize the importance of education both in the Massai community, and in my own.

          <p>
            I spent a month in Paris, France studying the relationship between mathematic concepts, art, architecture, and urban planning. We covered topics in the classroom like graph theory, the Golden Ratio, and geometric patterns, and then we would apply those academic findings to sites around the city. During the program, we visited a variety of additional locations for various academic purposes:
            <ul>
              <li>
                Giverny, France - Here, we visited the home and garden of the great Impressionist painter, Claude Monet. We also visited several museums in the area honoring his art and the artistic movement on which he had great influence.
              </li>
              <li>
                Geneva, Switzerland - We stayed at the CERN campus to engage with students, researchers, and on-location UW professors to learn about the Large Hadron Accelerator and the elements of particle physics. 
              </li>
              <li>
                Brussels, Belgium - I came to Brussels for independent travel after the UW program had ended. Here, I visited the Atomium, Brussels' museum of Industry and Innovation.
